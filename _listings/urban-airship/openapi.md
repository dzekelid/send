      summary: Post Airmail Send
      description: Sends a message. All fields except message are optional, but at
        least one of tags, users or aliases must be specified. Much like the push
        API, we have a batch API call that can make sending multiple messages easier.
        It???s located at /api/airmail/send/batch/ and accepts a list of messages
        in the same format as the standard push call.
