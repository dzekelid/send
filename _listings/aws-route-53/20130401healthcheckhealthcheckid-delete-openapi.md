  description: Deletes a health check. Send a DELETE request to the/2013-04-01/healthcheck/health

    deleting a health check even if the health check isassociated with one or more
    resource record sets. If you delete a health check and you don'tupdate the associated
    resource record sets, the future status of the health check can't bepredicted
    and may change. This will affect the routing of DNS queries for your DNS failoverconfiguration.
